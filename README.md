android letterboxd client offering a subset of [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) functionality with a focus on inclusive design.

## Running

You'll need to add `letterboxd.properties` to the root project directory:

```
apiKey=your_letterboxd_api_key
apiSecret=your_letterboxd_api_secret
username=your_username
password=your_password
```

(The username and password properties will be removed/made optional once a form is added to allow the user to enter their credentials.)
