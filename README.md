android letterboxd client offering a subset of [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) functionality with a focus on inclusive design.

## Running

You'll need to add `letterboxd.properties` to the root project directory:

```
apiKey=your_letterboxd_api_key
apiSecret=your_letterboxd_api_secret
```

You can add your username and password in that file too and it'll auto-fill the credentials boxes on DEBUG builds:

```
apiKey=your_letterboxd_api_key
apiSecret=your_letterboxd_api_secret
username=your_username
password=your_password
```
